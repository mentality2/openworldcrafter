        <!-- The scripts here are a little confusing, so an explanation is
        warranted. Basically, this first script sets up a global function, $go,
        that is called to create and display the page. Then, the native code is
        loaded and run. That code, in js/native.js (or platform-dependent
        equivalent) does whatever native stuff it needs to, like injecting the
        fs module, waiting for ondeviceready (cordova), etc. Then, it
        dynamically loads bundle.js by creating a new script tag and adding it
        to the page. Then, it calls $go(). The same principle applies in
        editor.htm. -->

                    $owf.loadWelcome()

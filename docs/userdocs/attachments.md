# Attachments

Attachments allow you to add images to your project. Attachments can be added to
any item, and they have their own tab:

![Attachments tab](attachments_tab.png)

To upload an attachment, enter [Edit Mode](#editing) and click "Upload". You
will see a window that looks like this:

![Upload window](upload_window.png)

You can either drag files from your desktop or folders into the blue box, or you
can click "Choose Files" to find a file. You can add multiple files at once.
When you have all the files you want to upload, click the "Upload" button to add
the files to the project.

You can also add titles and captions to your attachments. This is what Edit Mode
looks like for the Attachments tab:

When you are finished uploading, be sure to save your work.

Notes are the most basic items in a project. Use them to keep track of different
aspects of your world. Each note can hold text, as well as other notes.

Characters are a special type of note that has two extra tabs:
[Relationships](#relationships) and [Character Sheet](#character_chart).
These tools can help you keep better track of your characters.

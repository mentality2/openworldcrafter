# ![open world factory](../logos/header.svg) Notes and Characters

Notes are the most basic items in a project. Use them to keep track of different
aspects of your world. Each note can hold text, as well as other notes.

Characters are a special type of note that has two extra tabs:
[Relationships](relationships.md) and [Character Sheet](characterchart.md).
These tools can help you keep better track of your characters.

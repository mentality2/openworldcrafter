# ![open world factory](../logos/header.svg) Folders, Notes, and Characters

Notes are the most basic items in a project. Use them to keep track of different
aspects of your world.

Characters are very similar to notes, but they are used for specific characters
in a world.

Folders are organizational items, like folders on your desktop, that can contain
other items. Folders are just a special type of note, so you can write in them
as well.

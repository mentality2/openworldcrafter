# ![open world factory](../logos/header.svg) Markdown Formatting

The Markdown editor allows you to format your notes. You can use bold and
italic, insert tables, lists, and bullet points, and even add emoji.

This document outlines the Markdown editor toolbar. If you would like to learn
the raw syntax, [go to the syntax documentation](markdown_syntax.md).

# Bold, Italic, and Strikethrough
These buttons are straightforward. The three buttons on the left are, in order,
**bold,** *italic,* and ~~strikethrough.~~

# Headers
There are three levels of headers in the editor. Use the next three buttons to
add one of these headers.

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

# Quotes
Quotes are paragraphs shown with extra indentation, like this:

> "Not every quote on the Internet is true, or even attributed to the right
person." -- Albert Einstein

Use the quote button to add a quote.

# Numbered and Bullet Lists
The Numbered List button inserts a numbered list, like this:

1. Go to the castle
2. Sneak into the kitchen
3. Don't get caught
4. Eat as much as you want

The Bullet List button inserts an unordered list.

- Cats
- Dogs
- Fish
- Rats

# Tables
Click the Table button to add a table. By default, it will have two columns. It
will look like this:

    | Table Header | Table Header |
    |--------------|--------------|
    | Table Data   | Table Data   |

You can add more columns or rows by copying this style. For example, to add a
column, you would add this:

    | Table Header | Table Header | My Header |
    |--------------|--------------|-----------|
    | Table Data   | Table Data   | Table Data|

The table above will look like this when you leave Edit Mode:


| Table Header | Table Header | My Header |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Table Data   | Table Data   | Table Data|

# Emoji
Most common emoticons are automatically converted into emoji. For example, `:-)`
becomes :-) and `:/` becomes :/.

For other emoji, click the Emoji button and choose the one you want to insert.

# Links
Items can link to other items in the project or to webpages on the Internet.

To create a link to a webpage, paste the URL into the editor, select it, and
click the Link button. This will transform it into a link. External links will
open in your browser when you click them.

To create a link to another item in your project, click the Link button. A
search box will appear where you can search the project. Click on the object you
would like to link, and the link code will be inserted.

# Embed Videos
You can embed content from Youtube and Vimeo into your notes using the Embed
button.

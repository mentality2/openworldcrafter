The Relationships tab keeps track of each character's relationships with other
characters.

To add a relationship to a character, go to their Relationships tab, enter Edit
Mode, and click "Add Relationship." The following window will appear.

You can choose a relationship from the dropdown menu, or choose "other" to enter
your own. Then, use the search box to search the project for the other
character.

If the characters' roles are reversed, click "Swap Roles." For
example, the preset shown above ("Brother/Sister") lists Mary Sue as the brother
by default. "Swap Roles" fixes this issue.

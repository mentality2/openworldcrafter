# ![open world factory](logos/header.svg) About

This is a project I created because I enjoy writing fiction, especially fantasy,
and I like to keep all the facts straight about my worlds. Many authors
use wiki software for this purpose, but I think that solution is inelegant. I
want something that is made specifically for writers and worldbuilders, and
here it is!
